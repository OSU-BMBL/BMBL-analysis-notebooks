## Introduction

The Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) is a comprehensive reference dataset that provides a detailed annotation of lung cell types based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This document outlines the methodology and pipeline used for annotating single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data using HLCA.

## HLCA Annotation Pipeline

### Pipeline Input

The HLCA annotation pipeline requires the following inputs:

- **Query scRNA-seq: Processed count matrices.
    
- **Reference HLCA dataset**: Pre-annotated dataset containing known lung cell types.
    
- **Metadata file**: Includes sample information, batch identifiers, and pre-processing details.
    

### Pipeline Output

The annotation pipeline provides:

- **Cell type annotations per cell

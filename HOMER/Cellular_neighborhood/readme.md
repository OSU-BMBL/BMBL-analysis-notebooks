## Introduction
The immune tumor microenvironment (iTME) represents a complex integration of tumor, immune, stromal, and extracellular elements. The spatial organization of these components at both cellular and tissue levels is pivotal in determining the efficacy of antitumor immune responses. The present method is useful to identify the principal component of association between cell types and cellular neighborhood.
## Setup
1.	Download the python code, and open in the jupyter notebook
2.	Change the ‘path_to_data’ to the location of your csv file
3.	The data file must contain the following elements:
    - patients – represent each sample
    - groups – optional, only if there are two distinct patient subgroups
    - neighborhood10 – cell neighborhood annotation
    - ClusterName – cell type annotation
4.	Run the python code sequentially
